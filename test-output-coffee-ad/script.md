[Timestamp: 00:00 - 00:06]

[VISUAL/SHOT DESCRIPTION]

A hand reaches into frame, carefully selecting individual beans with deliberate, reverent movements. Steam rises gently in the background.

## SCENE 2: The Craft
[Timestamp: 00:06 - 00:14]

[VISUAL/SHOT DESCRIPTION]
Series of quick, artful shots: Coffee grinder in action (overhead shot), fresh grounds cascading into portafilter (slow motion, 120fps), barista hands expertly tamping with precision. Each shot is beautifully lit with natural window light. Shallow depth of field keeps focus on the coffee preparation.

[ACTION/DIRECTION]
Expert hands move with practiced confidence - grinding, measuring, tamping. Each movement is purposeful and elegant, showing mastery of craft.

[DIALOGUE]
NARRATOR: Sourced from single-origin farms. Roasted to perfection. Crafted with care.

[AUDIO/MUSIC]
Music builds slightly. Sound design: grinder whirring, gentle tamping, espresso machine hissing - all mixed to be satisfying and ASMR-like.

## SCENE 3: The Moment

Cut to medium shot of a person (30s-40s, relatable, genuine smile) lifting the cup, steam rising. Soft focus background of a peaceful morning setting - perhaps a reading nook or kitchen bathed in morning light.

[ACTION/DIRECTION]
Coffee pours in mesmerizing slow motion. Person takes the cup, pauses to appreciate the aroma (eyes close briefly in satisfaction), then takes that first perfect sip. Genuine moment of contentment washes over their face.

[DIALOGUE]
NARRATOR: This isn't just coffee. This is your moment.

[AUDIO/MUSIC]
Music reaches gentle crescendo. Sound of coffee pouring, cup being lifted, satisfied exhale.
